Also here, most of integer*2 arrays have been replaced by integer*4 ones.
Except in reijkl.f and ai.f where it is the interface with the ijkl part of
the program.

Also, the call of the subroutine morue.f have been disabled. A mysterious
error :

ld: morue.o r_value (0xb71f18c9) field of relocation entry 115 in section (__TEXT,__text) out of range

was generated during the compilation because of this subroutine. It seems that
the bd (diagonalization) calculation seems to be fine with thatâ€¦

Dimensions have, of course, been increased. Check the pshf.prm file :)
